# Rust Ray Tracing

## Creating a Ray Tracer

A ray tracer at it's core sends rays through pixels and computes the color seen in the direction of those rays.

### Checking if we hit Spheres

This calculation is pretty simple, we can just use the vector form of the sphere equation and after substituting in our vector we then solve the discriminate with the number of real roots we have being the amount of times we hit our sphere
